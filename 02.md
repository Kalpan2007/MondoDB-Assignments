# Practice Assignment:
## 1. Additional Questions on CRUD Operations:

Insert new students into the "students" collection with random data.
Update the department of a student based on their roll number.
Remove all students who have enrolled in less than 3 courses.

```
db.students.insertMany([
  { 
    "name": "student-12",
    "rollNumber": 12,
    "department": "Mechanical Engineering",
    "year": 1,
    "coursesEnrolled": ["ME101", "ME102"]
  },
  { 
    "name": "student-13",
    "rollNumber": 13,
    "department": "Civil Engineering",
    "year": 2,
    "coursesEnrolled": ["CE201", "CE202"]
  },
  { 
    "name": "student-14",
    "rollNumber": 14,
    "department": "Electrical Engineering",
    "year": 3,
    "coursesEnrolled": ["EE301", "EE302"]
  },
  { 
    "name": "student-15",
    "rollNumber": 15,
    "department": "Computer Science",
    "year": 2,
    "coursesEnrolled": ["CS103", "CS104"]
  }
]);





```
## 2. Aggregation Exercise:

Use aggregation to find the department with the most number of students.



## 3. Advanced Querying Exercise:

Query students who have enrolled in a specific set of courses (e.g., CS101 and MATH101).

```
db.students.find({
  "coursesEnrolled": { $all: ["CS101", "MATH101"] }
});
```



## 4. Indexing and Performance:

Experiment with creating indexes on various fields like department, year, etc., and measure the query performance using explain().
